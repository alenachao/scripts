# Random Scripts ⚙️
A soon to be collection of scripts to hopefully automate my life a bit.


## [wip] Google Calendar Upload 🗓️ 
Given a csv file, upload events onto their google calendar.

## Future Ideas 🔮:
- Spotify doesn't notify you when you get a new follower. Maybe something that emails you or notifies you the next time you open spotify if your follower count has changed.
- Ever wonder who's not following you back? A script that tells you who's not following you back on spotify (unfortunately their api doesn't support this rn)
