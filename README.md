# Random Scripts ‚öôÔ∏è
A soon to be collection of scripts to hopefully automate my life a bit. 
<br><br>
For all scripts you will need to clone the repo. For SSH:
```
git clone git@github.com:alenachao/scripts.git
```
## Implemented Ideas ‚úÖ:
- Google Calendar Upload: Given a CSV file of google calendar events, add them all to the user's Google Calendar.

## In Progress üí≠:
- Spotify Follower: Ever wonder who's not following you back? A script that tells you who's not following you back on Spotify

## Future Ideas üîÆ:
- Spotify doesn't notify you when you get a new follower. Maybe something that emails you or notifies you the next time you open spotify if your follower count has changed.
