# Random Scripts ‚öôÔ∏è
A soon to be collection of scripts that are somewhat relevant to my life. 
<br><br>
For all scripts you will need to clone the repo. For SSH:
```
git clone git@github.com:alenachao/scripts.git
```
## Implemented Ideas ‚úÖ:
- Google Calendar Upload: Given a CSV file of google calendar events, add them all to the user's Google Calendar.
- Spotify Language Learning: Given a language and your Spotify profile, create a playlist of songs that match your tastes and are in the chosen language, helping you discover new music and learn a new language.

## In Progress üí≠:

## Future Ideas üîÆ:
- Spotify doesn't notify you when you get a new follower. Maybe something that emails you or notifies you the next time you open spotify if your follower count has changed.'
- script that tell you if someone is not following u back on some social media platform
